Instructions to run the end-to-end (e2e) standalone scripts without the jupyter notebooks.

The scripts are in $GAIA_ROOT/e2e

The working directory defined currently for the products of the e2e are in $GAIA_ROOT/e2e_products

Directories:
$GAIA_ROOT/e2e_products/plotsSelect  (plots from the selection process)
$GAIA_ROOT/e2e_products/votables     (GAIA votable for the clusters)

Scripts by order of execution:
1. check_sampleOCdr2.py : from a list only to check the GAIA data towards the targets
2. get_allVotable.py    : get all the GAIA votable from the selected list
3. optimize_fulldbscan_oc.jl : compute the optimum DBSCAN parameters for the oc extraction. Output 2 csv file with DBSCAN and SC parameters
4. ... get the oc within the threshold for the DBSCAN parameters.
5. ... extract the oc with the DBSCAN parameters.
